This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built using the AdventureWorks dataset to analyze sales, profitability, orders, and returns across different product hierarchies. The report provides a comprehensive view of business performance by breaking down data into Product Categories, Subcategories, and individual Products.

The dashboard enables stakeholders to track key KPIs such as Revenue, Profit, Orders, and Return Rate, analyze monthly revenue trends, and identify top-performing and high-return products. Using interactive visuals and drill-down capabilities, users can easily explore product-level insights and understand which product segments contribute most to overall business performance.

This project demonstrates strong skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, and building intuitive Power BI reports that support data-driven decision-making.
